## Week 6 – Free 6-Weekends NodeJS Backend Development Course

### You will learn:

-   **Apache Kafka for High-Volume Data Processing:**
    Implement Kafka as a distributed streaming platform to handle ETL-style batch processing, high-volume workloads, and asynchronous backend pipelines.
-   **Full Dockerized Multi-Service Architecture:**
    Package Express, Redis, and Kafka into isolated containers, orchestrate them using Docker Compose, and run a scalable backend environment consistently across machines.
-   **NestJS Framework (Enterprise-Grade Backend Development:**
    Re-create your entire backend system in NestJS — a modular, scalable, TypeScript-driven framework used by enterprise companies.

### Week Overview

This weekend marked a transformative shift in your backend engineering skills, taking you into the world of **streaming pipelines, and enterprise-grade frameworks**.

On **Saturday**, you learned how to use **Apache Kafka** to process large volumes of data in a scalable, fault-tolerant manner — exactly how real ETL and streaming systems operate in production. You implemented a backend API designed to push high-volume messages into Kafka, demonstrating how modern applications handle heavy workloads asynchronously rather than blocking the server.

You also expanded your containerization skills by dockerizing all core components: **ExpressJS, Redis, Kafka, and Zookeeper**, then orchestrating them with Docker Compose to simulate a fully-distributed production environment.

On **Sunday**, you finalised Kafka integration and stepped into **NestJS**, rebuilding your existing backend project using a framework purpose-built for modular architecture, clean separation of concerns, TypeScript support, and enterprise scalability. You recreated core features from your ExpressJS project — now structured using NestJS modules, controllers, services, and dependency injection.

By the end of the weekend, you saw firsthand how the same backend logic can be implemented using two major paradigms: lightweight ExpressJS and enterprise NestJS.

### After Completing This Week

You now have hands-on understanding of technologies used by top engineering teams:

-   You can implement **Kafka-based ETL and streaming pipelines**, allowing your backend to handle millions of events efficiently.

-   You can **containerize and orchestrate multi-service environments** with Kafka, Redis, and NodeJS using Docker Compose.

-   You can build production-ready backend systems using **ExpressJS** and **NestJS**, following enterprise conventions such as dependency injection and layered architecture.

Your skills have moved beyond traditional API development — you are now working with distributed systems, scalable message queues, and enterprise application frameworks used in real-world production environments.

**_NOTE:_** The conversion of project from ExpressJS to NestJS is still ongoing. Updates will be made periodically till it is completely done.
