Recommended compilerOptions for a Node.js TypeScript project

target: "ES2022" (or "ESNext")
Defines the version of JavaScript that TypeScript will compile to.
For modern Node versions (v18+), ES2022 or ESNext is recommended.

module: "NodeNext" or "CommonJS"
Determines the module system used in the compiled output.

Use "NodeNext" if your project uses native import/export (ESM).

Use "CommonJS" if your project uses require() syntax.

moduleResolution: "NodeNext" or "Node"
Controls how TypeScript resolves imports.
If you’re using "NodeNext" module system, also use "NodeNext" resolution.

rootDir: "src"
Specifies the folder where your TypeScript source files are located.

outDir: "dist"
Tells TypeScript where to output the compiled JavaScript files.

esModuleInterop: true
Allows seamless interoperation between CommonJS and ES Modules.
This lets you use import express from "express"; even for CommonJS modules.

resolveJsonModule: true
Enables importing .json files directly into TypeScript modules.

strict: true
Turns on all strict type checking options — ensuring safer and more reliable code.

skipLibCheck: true
Skips type checking of .d.ts files inside node_modules.
This speeds up compilation and is safe for most projects.

forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true
Ensures file name casing is consistent across imports,
preventing issues when moving code between case-sensitive systems.

types: ["node"]
Includes Node.js type definitions globally, giving you IntelliSense for process, __dirname, etc.

include: ["src/**/*"]
Specifies which files and folders TypeScript should include in compilation.

exclude: ["node_modules", "dist"]
Prevents TypeScript from compiling external dependencies and build outputs.
