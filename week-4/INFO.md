### Week Overview

This week, we started our project for the course. We moved from core concepts to practical implementation by introducing our project's modular architecture and data layer. We transitioned from in-memory data handling to a persistent, robust solution by exploring SQL fundamentals and the MySQL database system. The focus was on hands-on integration, as we connected our Express.js backend to MySQL, establishing the foundation for all data-driven features.

### After Completing This Week

You will have successfully integrated a production-ready database into your backend application. You now understand the basics of SQL and can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations from your Node.js/Express server. Your blog backend is no longer a prototype; it is a dynamic system that can persistently store and manage data, a critical milestone in becoming a confident backend developer.
